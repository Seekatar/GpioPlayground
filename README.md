# GpioPlayground
My playground for RaspberryPi, Arduino, and other microcontrollers. Fritzing diagrams are supplied for most projects. Samples in Python, C++, and C#.

#Highlights

##NeopixelNightlight
Using the [NeoPixel ring](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1643), this project creates a multi-mode 
nightlight to allow someone who needs glasses to tell how long before
the alarm will be going off.  See more [here](https://github.com/Seekatar/GpioPlayground/wiki) 

##TempPressSensor
This uses the [Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3010), [Feather Wing OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2900), and [BME280 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2652) to report to Adafruit's [IoT](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io) service.

##NeoPixel, NeoPixelBacklight
Has samples using [NeoPixel ring](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1643) for a clock or a backlight controlled with pots.

##BAM\RpiPy\BamMatrix
Uses an 8x8 LED grid to display text scrolling in any direction, or animations.

Plus other low-level samples.
